        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Using a high-protein drink like Premier Protein® Salted Caramel and gingerbread morphs this regular overnight oats into the flavors of fall. I find adding the spices overnight dilutes the flavors, so I suggest waiting to add most of the spices before serving.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>¼ pear, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
            <li>6 ounces caramel-flavored protein shake (such as Premier Protein®)</li>
            <li>½ cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <l1>Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. Saute pear, walnuts, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon until pear softens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</l1>
            <l1>Combine protein drink and oats in a small Mason jar. Mix in cooled pear and walnuts. Seal and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</l1>
            <l1>Add pumpkin spice, ginger, and remaining cinnamon to the oats the following morning. Stir to combine.</l1>
        </ol>
